# Analog-Project---EMG-Based-Muscle-Strain-Detector

Our EEG-based Muscle Signal Detector is an innovative device designed to capture and analyze EMG signals to monitor muscle activity effectively. By accurately detecting electrical signals generated by muscle contractions, the system amplifies and filters the signals to ensure precision. The processed data is then used to determine the user's muscle strain level, which is displayed as high, medium, or low thresholds. This device provides an efficient and reliable solution for muscle strain monitoring, making it ideal for applications in rehabilitation, sports science, and biomedical research.

The device captures muscle signals using \textbf{three electrodes} placed on the skin. The weak EMG signals are amplified through an instrumentation amplifier for precision and noise reduction. The amplified signals are then filtered using two Sallen-Key low-pass filters to remove unwanted noise and isolate the relevant frequency range.

The filtered signal is fed into a comparator, which determines the muscle strain level by comparing the signal to predefined thresholds. The output strain levels low, medium, or high are displayed through LED indicators connected to the comparator, providing a clear and immediate visual representation of muscle activity. This streamlined process ensures accurate and real-time monitoring of muscle strain

The amplified signals are then filtered using two Sallen-Key low-pass filters to remove unwanted noise and isolate the relevant frequency range. The filtered signal is fed into a comparator, which determines the muscle strain level by comparing the signal to predefined thresholds. The output strain levels—low, medium, or high—are displayed through LED indicators connected to the comparator, providing a clear and immediate visual representation of muscle activity. This streamlined process ensures accurate and real-time monitoring of muscle strain.
